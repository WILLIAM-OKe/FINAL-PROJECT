day 1
I have finally started and decided to do the whole thing in one powershell script
nevermind apperently sql in powershell is a little dumb
I then started a python script instead.

Day 2
multiple problems have arisen mainly due to python sucking at everything forcing me to import like 50 things.
also http cannot download pictures in a url so I needed to import urllib, also urllib causes issues with sqlite
os needed to be imported for obivous reasons mainly to make a directory to put the images in.
but also to make paths work.

Day 3
toady I pet my dog and added a thingy to check to see if the connection was successful.
made very litte progress.

Day 4
Countinued with the DB updates and insert statements
had a few problems locating the files but that was mainly logical errors.
imported time to get the current time and spent like 30mins trying to format it nicely

Day 5 
finally rounded out the code and created the final powershell script.
added the comments
